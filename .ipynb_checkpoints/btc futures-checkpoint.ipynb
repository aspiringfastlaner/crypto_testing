    "## CBOE Bitcoin Futures (XBT) Vs. CME Bitcoin Futures (BTC)\n",
    "\n",
    "__CBOE's XBT: 1X Multiplier__\n",
    "- CBOE’s contracts are based on a daily auction price from Gemini.\n",
    "- Gemini is a virtual currency exchange run by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n",
    "- Investors may not own or control more than a net 5,000 contracts, long or short combined, and the global market will be open for more than 23 hours.\n",
    "- CBOE will demand from investors an initial margin of 33% to back the trades in its clearing house.\n",
    "- The CBOE will waive all fees on Bitcoin trading for the month of December.\n",
    "\n",
    "__CME's BTC: 5X Multiplier__\n",
    "- CME’s prices are a composite derived from four Bitcoin exchanges.\n",
    ">- Bitstamp\n",
    ">- GDAX\n",
    ">- itBit\n",
    ">- Kraken\n",
    "- CME is also planning to limit the amount of contracts investors can hold to 1,000 (equivalent to CBOE because 1 contract = 5 bitcoins).\n",
    "- CME will demand from investors an initial margin of 35% to back the trades in its clearing house.\n",
    "- CME will introduce a market maker program to support the on-screen market development of Bitcoin futures.\n",
    "- The CME will provide a 50% discount to all market participants for CME Globex spread transactions through May 31, 2018.\n",
    "- The CME Group has a vested interest in the success of this product due to its ownership stake in Digital Currency Group, the parent of CoinDesk, a prominent leader in the digital currency world."
